Extraordinary.Cities: Skylines not only offers breath taking visuals, it also features captivating game play by implementing the most moddable options we've seen in a city sim to date. Without a doubt the asset editor is probably one of the most brilliant ideas included with this game. Ever play a city sim where some buildings are not to your liking, require too much space or you just don\\u2019t like the general set out of them? Not anymore, you can change absolutely everything to suit your preferences and gameplay style. Once you get taken into your citizen\\u2019s messages via chirper it is unbelievably easy to lose time whilst playing this game. I cannot tell you how much time I\\u2019ve spent re-routing traffic in order to get it working smoothly, so don\\u2019t be surprised if a quick fix for heavy traffic areas become a grand plan that takes more than the quick couple of minutes you had anticipated before starting. Cities: Skylines has completely revolutionised the whole genre of city sims. Keep in mind this is just the start of something great, I cannot wait to see what else can come of this genre after such a phenomenal milestone. 11/10\",\n          \"Counter Strike Global Offensive is a great game. I think changes can be made with the banning system for competitive for example not having to wait a whole day to play another competitive match -_-. But thats my opinion. this game is nicley finished with the graphics on medium it still looks just as good as you see teams like Fnatic or Dignatitus play with. I think personaly that Dust || can have much less play time i think ive played over 1000 matchs on the god damn map. the community is great when you are not matched with idiots. The skins in this game are really nice love em' when you finally get that skin you want out of a case the amazment is just great most of the time im speachless but its great. Stattracks are a great idea Valve im personaly not a fan of some of the skins  but most of them are great and good looking and  money can be made $$. The knife, teh knife so rare and they cost so much to buy off the market. Look over all Counter Stike Global Offensive is a great game that i would play all day if i could. If you think this is another COD game your are mistaken my friend it is better than battlefield and COD combined.Over all i would give CS:GO  a 9.5/10 for the simple reason for having to wait so long when beeing banned\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":18}],"source":["normalized_df = json_normalize(expanded_df['reviews'])\n","normalized_df"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":545},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":485,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710798206956,"user":{"displayName":"Lucas Colantoni","userId":"07036269525028736454"},"user_tz":180},"id":"0VqBOMdj-I9N","outputId":"35fe5a55-a6d7-40d1-a7ab-2c35b3e6f167"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                 user_id                                           user_url  \\\n","0      76561197970982479  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970...   \n","1      76561197970982479  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970...   \n","2      76561197970982479  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970...   \n","3                js41637               http://steamcommunity.com/id/js41637   \n","4                js41637               http://steamcommunity.com/id/js41637   \n","...                  ...                                                ...   \n","59328  76561198312638244  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198312...   \n","59329  76561198312638244  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198312...   \n","59330        LydiaMorley           http://steamcommunity.com/id/LydiaMorley   \n","59331        LydiaMorley           http://steamcommunity.com/id/LydiaMorley   \n","59332        LydiaMorley           http://steamcommunity.com/id/LydiaMorley   \n","\n","                          posted item_id  \\\n","0       Posted November 5, 2011.    1250   \n","1          Posted July 15, 2011.   22200   \n","2         Posted April 21, 2011.   43110   \n","3          Posted June 24, 2014.  251610   \n","4      Posted September 8, 2013.  227300   \n","...                          ...     ...   \n","59328            Posted July 10.      70   \n","59329             Posted July 8.  362890   \n","59330             Posted July 3.  273110   \n","59331            Posted July 20.     730   \n","59332             Posted July 2.     440   \n","\n","                                               helpful recommend  \\\n","0                                       No ratings yet      True   \n","1                                       No ratings yet      True   \n","2                                       No ratings yet      True   \n","3      15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful      True   \n","4         0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful      True   \n","...                                                ...       ...   \n","59328                                   No ratings yet      True   \n","59329                                   No ratings yet      True   \n","59330    1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful      True   \n","59331                                   No ratings yet      True   \n","59332                                   No ratings yet      True   \n","\n","                                                  review  \n","0      Simple yet with great replayability.

Extraordinary.Cities: Skylines not only offers breath taking visuals, it also features captivating game play by implementing the most moddable options we've seen in a city sim to date. Without a doubt the asset editor is probably one of the most brilliant ideas included with this game. Ever play a city sim where some buildings are not to your liking, require too much space or you just don\\u2019t like the general set out of them? Not anymore, you can change absolutely everything to suit your preferences and gameplay style. Once you get taken into your citizen\\u2019s messages via chirper it is unbelievably easy to lose time whilst playing this game. I cannot tell you how much time I\\u2019ve spent re-routing traffic in order to get it working smoothly, so don\\u2019t be surprised if a quick fix for heavy traffic areas become a grand plan that takes more than the quick couple of minutes you had anticipated before starting. Cities: Skylines has completely revolutionised the whole genre of city sims. Keep in mind this is just the start of something great, I cannot wait to see what else can come of this genre after such a phenomenal milestone. 11/10\",\n          \"Counter Strike Global Offensive is a great game. I think changes can be made with the banning system for competitive for example not having to wait a whole day to play another competitive match -_-. But thats my opinion. this game is nicley finished with the graphics on medium it still looks just as good as you see teams like Fnatic or Dignatitus play with. I think personaly that Dust || can have much less play time i think ive played over 1000 matchs on the god damn map. the community is great when you are not matched with idiots. The skins in this game are really nice love em' when you finally get that skin you want out of a case the amazment is just great most of the time im speachless but its great. Stattracks are a great idea Valve im personaly not a fan of some of the skins  but most of them are great and good looking and  money can be made $$. The knife, teh knife so rare and they cost so much to buy off the market. Look over all Counter Stike Global Offensive is a great game that i would play all day if i could. If you think this is another COD game your are mistaken my friend it is better than battlefield and COD combined.Over all i would give CS:GO  a 9.5/10 for the simple reason for having to wait so long when beeing banned\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":19}],"source":["result_df = pd.concat([expanded_df.reset_index(drop=True), normalized_df], axis=1)\n","result_df = result_df.drop_duplicates(subset=['user_id', 'user_url', 'item_id', 'recommend', 'review'])\n","columnas = ['reviews','funny','last_edited']\n","result_df = result_df.drop(columns=columnas)\n","result_df\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ocALWRUSb5hH"},"source":["Extraemos las interacciones con la review de otros usuarios\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":20,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":423},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":489,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710798207442,"user":{"displayName":"Lucas Colantoni","userId":"07036269525028736454"},"user_tz":180},"id":"h4xyHGGhdwNd","outputId":"0b52067d-01e0-4034-a793-1ed7535ecc70"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                 user_id                                           user_url  \\\n","0      76561197970982479  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970...   \n","1      76561197970982479  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970...   \n","2      76561197970982479  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970...   \n","3                js41637               http://steamcommunity.com/id/js41637   \n","4                js41637               http://steamcommunity.com/id/js41637   \n","...                  ...                                                ...   \n","59328  76561198312638244  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198312...   \n","59329  76561198312638244  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198312...   \n","59330        LydiaMorley           http://steamcommunity.com/id/LydiaMorley   \n","59331        LydiaMorley           http://steamcommunity.com/id/LydiaMorley   \n","59332        LydiaMorley           http://steamcommunity.com/id/LydiaMorley   \n","\n","                          posted item_id recommend  \\\n","0       Posted November 5, 2011.    1250      True   \n","1          Posted July 15, 2011.   22200      True   \n","2         Posted April 21, 2011.   43110      True   \n","3          Posted June 24, 2014.  251610      True   \n","4      Posted September 8, 2013.  227300      True   \n","...                          ...     ...       ...   \n","59328            Posted July 10.      70      True   \n","59329             Posted July 8.  362890      True   \n","59330             Posted July 3.  273110      True   \n","59331            Posted July 20.     730      True   \n","59332             Posted July 2.     440      True   \n","\n","                                                  review  rev_utility  \n","0      Simple yet with great replayability.

Extraordinary.Cities: Skylines not only offers breath taking visuals, it also features captivating game play by implementing the most moddable options we've seen in a city sim to date. Without a doubt the asset editor is probably one of the most brilliant ideas included with this game. Ever play a city sim where some buildings are not to your liking, require too much space or you just don\\u2019t like the general set out of them? Not anymore, you can change absolutely everything to suit your preferences and gameplay style. Once you get taken into your citizen\\u2019s messages via chirper it is unbelievably easy to lose time whilst playing this game. I cannot tell you how much time I\\u2019ve spent re-routing traffic in order to get it working smoothly, so don\\u2019t be surprised if a quick fix for heavy traffic areas become a grand plan that takes more than the quick couple of minutes you had anticipated before starting. Cities: Skylines has completely revolutionised the whole genre of city sims. Keep in mind this is just the start of something great, I cannot wait to see what else can come of this genre after such a phenomenal milestone. 11/10\",\n          \"Counter Strike Global Offensive is a great game. I think changes can be made with the banning system for competitive for example not having to wait a whole day to play another competitive match -_-. But thats my opinion. this game is nicley finished with the graphics on medium it still looks just as good as you see teams like Fnatic or Dignatitus play with. I think personaly that Dust || can have much less play time i think ive played over 1000 matchs on the god damn map. the community is great when you are not matched with idiots. The skins in this game are really nice love em' when you finally get that skin you want out of a case the amazment is just great most of the time im speachless but its great. Stattracks are a great idea Valve im personaly not a fan of some of the skins  but most of them are great and good looking and  money can be made $$.
